<h2 id="why-beautiful-focus">Why beautiful focus</h2>
<p>Accessability should be a priority for every web-designer and developer these days. The web was built as an all-inclusive world we can all benefit from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The power of the Web is in its universality.<br>Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”
<cite>Tim Berners Lee</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However we have so much to do! So many things to build and so many features to push. It is often an overthought or a last minute job to try to “Add Accessability” to a website.</p>
<p>Designers hate that blue outline that chrome gives when you click a button...</p>
<p>You’ve done it before right? used the old</p>
<pre><code>&amp;:focus {
    outline: none;
}</code></pre><p>Well not anymore, stick Beautiful-Focus into your website, sit back and relax knowing that all users will get a great experience here.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Below details some useful information when using the Beautiful Focus lib.</p>
<h2 id="over-ride-the-styles">Over-ride the styles</h2>
<p>Simply style using the css id selector:</p>
<pre><code>#beautiful-focus {
 /* Your styles go here */
}</code></pre><h2 id="clearing-the-focus">Clearing the focus</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will want to manually clear the focus ring. To do so simply dispatch a custom window event like so:</p>
<pre><code>const event = new Event(&#39;clearFocus&#39;);
window.dispatchEvent(event);</code></pre><h2 id="single-page-apps">Single Page Apps</h2>
<p>Single Page Apps will need to inform Beautiful-Focus when the page has changed so it knows to clear itself up.</p>
<p>To do this we need to dispatch the above mention clearFocus event when the page changes.</p>
